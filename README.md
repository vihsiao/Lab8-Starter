Graceful degradation and service workers both have a common goal to enhance user experience by ensuring web applications remain functional regardless of the user's conditions. Graceful degradation ensures a website remains usable even if some advanced features fail or are unsupported on a user's browser. Service workers intercepts network requests and uses caching for offline access and to improve load times. By managing the network requests and providing fallbacks when the network is unavailable, service workers help maintain core functionalities of the application, thus supporting graceful degradation by ensuring that essential services continue to operate smoothly despite potential failures or limitations in the network or on the user's side.
